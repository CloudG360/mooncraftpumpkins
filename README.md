# Pumpkins: A Mooncraft Project

Pumpkin Lucky Blocks for the Mooncraft Games modded server. These were reskinned crates from the [SupplyKeys](https://github.com/CloudG360/mooncraftsupplykeys) plugin which offered their own custom items such as "charms", structures, and mobs.


This plugin inspired the item tags used in [AstroItemLib](https://github.com/CloudG360/AstroItemLib) as the custom item implementation in this plugin got out of hand.
